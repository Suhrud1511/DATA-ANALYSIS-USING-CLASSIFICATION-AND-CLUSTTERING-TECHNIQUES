**HCV of Egypt Dataset and Analysis
This repository contains the HCV of Egypt dataset and code for clustering and classification analysis in Python.



**Dataset**
The HCV of Egypt dataset includes clinical and laboratory data of 1385 patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Egypt. The dataset contains 29 variables, including demographic, clinical, and laboratory data.

**Analysis**
 
 The code in this repository includes:


**kmeans_clustering.py**: Performs k-means clustering on the dataset to identify groups of patients with similar features. The number of clusters can be adjusted.

**pca_analysis.py**: Applies principal component analysis (PCA) on the dataset to identify patterns and reduce dimensionality. The number of principal components can be adjusted.

**naive_bayes_classification.py**: Applies the Naive Bayes algorithm on the dataset 

**decision_tree_classification.py**: Applies the Decision Tree algorithm on the dataset 

**plot_clusters.py**: Creates a scatter plot of the dataset with colors corresponding to the cluster assignments from k-means clustering.
The code uses scikit-learn and matplotlib libraries for clustering, PCA, classification, and visualization.


**Usage**

To use this code, simply clone the repository and run the Python scripts in your preferred IDE or Jupyter Notebook. You can adjust the parameters for clustering, PCA, and classification to optimize the results.


The dataset is included in the repository in CSV format.
